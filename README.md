# student-internship-management-system
Backend API for managing student internships, applications, and company workflows using Node.js and Express.
## Problem Statement
Currently, internship opportunities are scattered across multiple platforms, making it difficult for students to find and apply to suitable positions.
Communication regarding application status and progress evaluation is not transparent, often handled only through email, which is inefficient and hard to track.
Additionally, student CVs often lack structured information, resulting in inconsistent and incomplete data, which makes it difficult for HR teams to assess applicants efficiently.
